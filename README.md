##  **Summary**
Book Search Engine takes the Google Books API built with RESTful API and refactors it into a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. This application uses the MERN stack as its foundation. Users will be able to sign up or login into to their account, search for a desired book, save desired book to personal list, as well as remove the book from saved books.
